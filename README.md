# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
## Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends. We focused on looking at the data for plays in the US and for musicals in Great Britain. 
### The purpose of this analysis is to help Louise determine the differences in successful campaigns and failed campaigns. By analyzing this data, we can try to determine why certain plays did better than others in raising money.
## US play outcomes

As we can see from the image above, there were a total of 412 successful plays, 250 failed plays, and 9 plays that are still active. We need to dive a bit deeper to understand why these numbers are what they are.

Looking at this graph, we can see the trends between the launch dates and the theatre categories that were successful, failed, canceled, or still live. We can see that the campaigns launched in May had the highest success rate, and a December launch date had the least amount of successful campaigns. The months of March and September also had fairly low success rates. So perhaps to have the most success when launching a campaign, May would be the month to do that
